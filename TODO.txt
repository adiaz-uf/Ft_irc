Handle Client Message Needs to aggregate the whole message not just take a part
    TO FIX: Client should have a buffer attribute and any message should be aggregated
    Only if "/r/n" is found should it be processed

IRCCommandHandler
    The way to identify channel should be done through message. 

    Client channel shouldnt be stored in client
        eg KICK <channel> <client> :[<message>]
        When youre on the client you dont need to do this because it will do it automatically for you.
        eg when you are in the channel in the ui the message sent to the server will have the channel appended so all you need to do is KICK <client> <msg>

    Need to implement a notice command for the evaluation

HEXCHAT
    At the moment it doesnt connect automatically - why?
